text: ðŸ’» Just got myself a NuPhy Air60 for commuting to the office in Warsaw! The office only has membrane keyboards, and since I really wanted to keep typing on a mechanical one, I decided to get something more portable. My main board â€” the NuPhy Halo 2 â€” is amazing, but itâ€™s just too heavy and bulky to carry around every day. So now Iâ€™ve got this slim and compact Air60 as my travel companion â€” mechanical feel, great typing experience, and super easy to pack ðŸ˜Ž
