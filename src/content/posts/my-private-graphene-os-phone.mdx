text: I've been focused on securing my own local systems for a long time, and I’m also careful not to hand over my personal data to large corporations. Proton  suite of services has been a huge help—I use the password manager, VPN, and email aliases, along with Tuta | Secure Email & Calendar for private email. For a while I’ve been concerned about mobile phones—especially Android—because they transmit a lot of telemetry and collect extensive analytics. I won’t even get started on how Facebook scans gallery content to train its neural networks. Now I’ve fully switched to GrapheneOS  and I couldn’t be happier. There’s zero telemetry; even location via Wi‑Fi and Bluetooth is completely disabled. You can block all access and retain total control over the operating system you carry in your pocket every day. In the fight against Big Tech, which essentially steals our data, GrapheneOS is the best choice.
